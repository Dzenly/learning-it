* Storage volumes
* Networks
* Clouds support


Now:
* CRI (container runtime interface)
* CNI (container network interface)
* CSI (container storage interface)

====

Docker - does not complain these standards, so there is wrapper - shim.

Dockershim translates CRI commands to Docker Engine commands.

=======

Docker images are compatible with OCI.

containerd is CRI compliant.

========

Otherwise, if youâ€™re using the open source Docker Engine, the dockershim project will
be available as an open source component,
and you will be able to continue to use it with Kubernetes;
it will just require a small configuration change, which we will document.
